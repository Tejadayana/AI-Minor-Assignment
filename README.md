A popular children’s riddle is “Brothers and sisters have I none, but that man’s father is
my father’s son.” Use the rules of the family domain (Section 8.3.2 on page 301 in the

**TODO:**    
Save the above code to a file called **riddle.pl.**    
Open SWI-Prolog.    
Load the program by entering the following in SWI-Prolog : **?- [riddle].**    
Query to find "that man": **?- that_man(X).**
